# Creating Interactive Websites with Three.js and GSAP
In modern web development, creating engaging and interactive experiences is key to capturing user attention. Two powerful libraries that help achieve this are Three.js and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). Below, we will explore how these tools can be used together to create interactive websites.

# What is Three.js?
Three.js is a JavaScript library that simplifies the creation and display of 3D graphics in a web browser. It abstracts the complexities of WebGL, providing an easy-to-use interface to create rich, interactive 3D environments.

Key Features:

Simple API to create 3D scenes, cameras, lights, and more.
Support for various geometries, materials, and textures.
Advanced features like shadows, post-processing, and custom shaders.
Large community and plenty of resources, examples, and documentation.

# What is GSAP?
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a high-performance JavaScript library for creating animations. It is known for its robustness, flexibility, and ease of use, making it a favorite among developers and designers.

Key Features:

Tweening: Smoothly animates properties over time.
Timeline: Sequences multiple animations for complex effects.
Compatibility: Works with CSS, SVG, canvas, and WebGL.
Performance: Optimized for speed, ensuring smooth animations.

# Why Use Three.js and GSAP Together?
Combining Three.js and GSAP allows developers to create visually stunning and highly interactive 3D web experiences. Three.js handles the rendering of 3D objects, while GSAP adds seamless animations to those objects, enhancing the interactivity and engagement of the website.
